The features deleteQuest and editQuest are essential for the administration
and management of quests in the StackUp contract. The deleteQuest function allows
the admin to remove a quest from the contract entirely. This feature is useful
in situations where a quest is no longer relevant or needs to be discontinued. By deleting
a quest, it ensures that it is no longer accessible to players, and the associated storage
space is freed up.

On the other hand, the editQuest function enables the admin to modify the properties of a quest.
This feature is crucial for scenarios where the admin needs to update quest details such as the
title, reward, or the number of rewards. By allowing edits to quests, the admin can adapt the game
dynamics, adjust rewards, or correct any errors or outdated information associated with a quest.
